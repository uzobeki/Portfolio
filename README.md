# Portfolio - HW02
To properly display the skills we're learning in the course, a portfolio is a necessity. Bootstrap made the process of creating this portfolio a lot less painless than I originally thought it would be.

In this assignment I created three pages consisting of a Homepage (index), a Portfolio page, and a Contact page.

## Homepage
I wanted my homepage to have my bio and also include a small taste of some of my favorite sites that I would work on down the line. To do this, I placed the bio and a slider with some placeholder images in their own halves of the 'About Me' section. The slider is nested within a card that conatins a button linked to my full portfolio page.

## Portfolio Page
I wanted the thumbnails to be more descriptive, so I placed them within cards. Each card has a row where I can place information such as, the type of site it was, who was the client, how long it took, what part I contributed to most, etc.

## Contact Page
The contact page contains a simple form that users can place the name, email, and a detailed message to send to me. This section utiizes half of the page. The other half is used for some text listing my phone, email and social media links.

Overall I enjoyed this assignment. My portfolio isn't exactly how I would like it to be, but I'm confident I can get it there.
